# Algorithmic Trading with Alpha Vantage

This ongoing project focuses on building machine learning models with stock market data from the Alpha Vantage API to guide effective trading strategies.


Here's what I'm aiming to achieve:

- Develop machine learning models to predict stock market trends.
- Create effective trading strategies based on those models.
- Deploy the models to Power BI and build a live dashboard to visualize real-time stock market trends.

This project is a work in progress, and I invite you to check out the project notebook to follow my journey. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions.
